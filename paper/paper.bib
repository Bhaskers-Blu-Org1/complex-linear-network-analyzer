abstract = {We present a tool that aids in the modeling of optical circuits, both in the frequency and in the time domain. The tool is based on the definition of a node, which can have both an instantaneous input-output relation and different state variables (e.g., temperature and carrier density) and differential equations for these states. Furthermore, each node has access to part of its input history, allowing the creation of delay lines or digital filters. Additionally, a node can contain subnodes, allowing the creation of hierarchical networks. This tool can be used in numerous applications such as frequency-domain analysis of optical ring filters, time-domain analysis of optical amplifiers, microdisks, and microcavities. Although we mainly use this tool to model optical circuits, it can also be used to model other classes of dynamical systems, such as electrical circuits and neural networks.},

@article{Bogaerts2012,
abstract = {An overview is presented of the current state-of-the-art in silicon nanophotonic ring resonators. Basic theory of ring resonators is discussed, and applied to the peculiarities of submicron silicon photonic wire waveguides: the small dimensions and tight bend radii, sensitivity to perturbations and the boundary conditions of the fabrication processes. Theory is compared to quantitative measurements. Finally, several of the more promising applications of silicon ring resonators are discussed: filters and optical delay lines, label-free biosensors, and active rings for efficient modulators and even light sources.},

@article{Vandoorne2014a,
abstract = {In today's age, companies employ machine learning to extract information from large quantities of data. One of those techniques, reservoir computing (RC), is a decade old and has achieved state-of-the-art performance for processing sequential data. Dedicated hardware realizations of RC could enable speed gains and power savings. Here we propose the first integrated passive silicon photonics reservoir. We demonstrate experimentally and through simulations that, thanks to the RC paradigm, this generic chip can be used to perform arbitrary Boolean logic operations with memory as well as 5-bit header recognition up to 12.5 Gbit s(-1), without power consumption in the reservoir. It can also perform isolated spoken digit recognition. Our realization exploits optical phase for computing. It is scalable to larger networks and much higher bitrates, up to speeds {\textgreater}100 Gbit s(-1). These results pave the way for the application of integrated photonic RC for a wide range of applications.},
